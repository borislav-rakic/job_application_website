                    In order to demonstrate my skills with JavaScript, I came up with three features on this website which I 
                    have built in.<br><br>

                    Firstly, we have the dark mode which can be activated or deactivated by clicking on the button in the upper right corner. 
                    Your settings should be saved in the LocalStorage so that if you would revisit the website in the future, your previous 
                    setting should be active. The default mode is the dark mode.<br><br>

                    The second feature I came up with is the button on the Home-page which will send you to a random page. This feature 
                    should be self-explanatory so I don't have much to add to that except that I paid attention that the button should not 
                    send the user to the page they are already on.<br><br>

                    All of the animations for the buttons and hyperlinks were also made with JavaScript and CSS. You may have noticed that 
                    when you hover over my image on the about me page, some information appears below.<br><br>

                    I know that those features aren't the most incredible features ever but I didn't want to pack too many features on this 
                    website since you surely don't have that much time on your hands. I would also like to emphasize that I only started 
                    working with JavaScript a short while ago.

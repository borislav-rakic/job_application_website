                    I was interested in computers since I was a child. The most interesting subject for me was how 
                    programs are made. The answer shocked me at first because I had heard so many new words like 
                    "programming language" or "IDE". <br><br>

                    But it also made me curious. Because of that I decided to develop a video game for iOS as my Matura paper at 
                    grammar school. I named my game "Defend Humanity". You can read more on that on the page "Defend Humanity for iOS".<br>
                    This gave me a first look into different aspects of software development since I didn't only program with swift, but
                    I also had to make sound effects and textures. Those tasks are of course also part of developing software and not 
                    just video games.<br><br>
                    
                    I signed up for a bachelors degree at ETH ZÃ¼rich after my Matura. Since then I have realized that I do not fit 
                    into the ETH lifestyle. But I don't see my time at ETH as wasted because I have learned many new things about different 
                    algorithms and about the programming language Java. <br>
                    Although JavaScript wasn't part of the curriculum at ETH, I was still able to "transfer" quite a bit of my knowledge 
                    of Java to JavaScript. Back when I was working on my Matura paper, I have also started learning HTML and CSS because I 
                    needed a site in order to be able to publish my app to the App Store. Shortly afterwards I have found Google sites and I 
                    decided to make my website with that instead because I didn't have much time left. But I started learning with those two 
                    programming languages a few weeks ago so that I could make this website you're looking at right now.<br><br>

                    Now I'm planning to switch to the university of Zurich. One reason would be because I can study with the Major in 
                    Software systems. This subject in computer science is the most interesting for me. Until then I'd like to 
                    collect a bit of experience in the professional fieldset, which is why I'm searching for an internship or something like 
                    a holiday job.

                    I started my studies in the University of Zurich in September 2022. Since I have to retake one module next semester and two modules in the semester after that, I wanted to get some field experience, which is why I am currently looking for an internship.

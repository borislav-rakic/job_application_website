                    Welcome to my website! This website will demonstrate some of my skills.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    First, I'd like to provide you with a link to the GitHub repository for this website.
                    You can review my code there and convince yourself of my skills. 
                    (Or you can just use the developer tools of your browser).
                </p>
                <div id = "github_link_container">
                    <img id = "github_link" src = "images/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png" onclick = "go_to_link('https://github.com/borislav-rakic/job_application_website')">
                    <p>GitHub repository</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Please keep in mind that I am only a beginner at the moment. Hence I obviously wouldn't be 
                    able to keep pace with other people who have been software or web developers for several years now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us start exploring now, shall we? Please click on the following button 
                    in order to be transfered to a random page.
                </p>
                <button id = "random_page" onclick = "go_to_random_page()">click here</button>

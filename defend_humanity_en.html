                    I had to choose a topic for my Matura paper in the year 2020. I already knew that I wanted to pursue 
                    something in computer science but I didn't know what exactly. Then I came upon the idea to develop an app, 
                    but not just any app. I decided to develop a video game for iOS.<br><br>
                    
                    I'd love to let you download the game but my Apple Developer membership ran out, which is why the app isn't available on the App Store anymore. While developing the game, I obviously didn't have much experience, which is visible in the game itself, since there are still a few bugs but I have learnt a lot since then.

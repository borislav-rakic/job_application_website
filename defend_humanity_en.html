                    I had to choose a topic for my Matura paper in the year 2020. I already knew that I wanted to pursue 
                    something in computer science but I didn't know what exactly. Then I came upon the idea to develop an app, 
                    but not just any app. I decided to develop a video game for iOS.<br><br>

                    download the app and test it. Please keep in mind that I had almost no experience in the field of software or 
                    game development.

                    The controls are relatively easy. As soon as you started a round you will be able to stear your ship by touching 
                    the left side of the phone. If you tap on the right side, you will be able to shoot. The goal is to 
                    eliminate as much enemy ships as possible before your own ship is eliminated.
